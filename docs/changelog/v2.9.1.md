Changelog v2.9.1
================

* Update of URLs to Scifabric
* We just added a feature to set user preferences for their preferred languages/locations and metadata such as users work hours, expertise about a user on account filing form. The user preferences and metadata would be available and modified from account profile page. In future, this could be useful for building a new scheduler that can assign tasks to a user based on his/her preferences set.
